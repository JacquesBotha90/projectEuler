# projectEuler

<b>My solutions to the Project Euler problems.</b> 

My aim is to solve each problem with all required tools contained in a single class. Furthermore, I am trying to write as many of the methods on my own, even if there is an existing Java method which can easily accomplish the task. This is especially true in the earlier problems. Feel free to give some constructive criticism on how I could improve.
